This project is set up to function like a blog site. This site is designed to be mainly read-only with only one "Admin" user that will be able to perform control actions on the site. The addition of the user is not possible through the front end of the web site, however, and will have to be manually inputted into the user database upon a database reset (e.g. when the project is pushed to heroku). The commands to do so are as follows. 

heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku run rails console
>user = User.new(:username => "Admin)
=> #This should print out a data structure depicting the User object. 
>user.save
=> #This should output "true"
>exit #This exits the rails console

Databases store User data as well as micropost data, the latter "belonging" to the former.

Spare in-progress code: 

/views/pages/archive.html.erb:
	<% @admin = User.find_by_id(params[1])%>
	<% @microposts = @admin.microposts%>
	<% unless @admin.microposts.empty?%>
	<table class = "microposts">
		<%= render @microposts%>
	</table>
	
	<% end %>
